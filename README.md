# CMPE209-Two-way-configurable-firewall
As part of our project, we have implemented the following: <br />
      We implemented a stateless firewall by using python in Linux based operating system. The rules can be configured by users. <br />
      The stateless firewall will filter both incoming and outgoing packets based on protocol, IP/MAC address and port number. <br />
      It can also block/unblock Facebook and limit number of connections. <br />
      We used python-iptables which contains security rules to set up our stateless firewall. <br />
